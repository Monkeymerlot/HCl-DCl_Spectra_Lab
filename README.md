# HCl/DCl IR Ro-Vibrational Spectroscopy Lab
 Code for Pitt's CHEM 1430 HCl/DCl IR Spectroscopy Lab. This lab had a lot of data analysis, but a lot of it was essentially programming the same thing over again for a different transition. So I took the code I had written and condensed it into a few functions that you can use for any transition. I will clean and add the remaining code I have written, which fit the peak wavenumbers vs their transition number to a function, and then returns the fitting parameters, along with computing other interesting/necessary values needed for this lab. Examples of how to use the functions can be found in either the `Examples.py` or the `Examples.ipynb`, which will render in the browser. 
 
 ## Dependencies
 This library depends on `Numpy`, `Scipy`, and `Matplotlib`. 

## Awknowledgements
Special thanks to my lab partner Forrest.
